# Husky_Payroll_Management_System_DAMG_6210

Project title and introduction
The title of the project is ‘Husky Payroll Management System’. This is a project primarily deals with the payroll system for the students who are on part-time jobs. We have designed a comprehensive database that stores all the required details pertaining to the student, supervisor, and the job.


Objectives of the project
The primary objective of this project is to accurately calculate the employee salaries and taxes, maintain a centralized database of employee information, and generate relevant reports for management.


Assumptions
To replicate the exact real-world problem as an academic project requires a lot of time and resources. So, to make it possible, we assumed that every job has a daily four-hour shift during weekdays i.e., five working days. And since tax rules are similar for both local and international students, citizenship information is irrelevant to this project.
